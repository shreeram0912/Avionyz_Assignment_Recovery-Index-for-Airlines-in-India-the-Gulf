# ✈️ Recovery Index for Airlines in India & the Gulf

### 📌 Problem Statement
1. The global aviation industry experienced unprecedented disruption due to COVID-19. Airlines across regions recovered at varying speeds based on factors such as financial strength, fleet strategy, passenger
   demand, and operational efficiency.
2. This project analyzes and compares the recovery trajectory of major Indian and Gulf airlines by evaluating key financial and operational indicators before and after COVID-19, using 2019 as the
   baseline year (Index = 100).
3. The goal is to derive structured, data-driven insights using real-world datasets.


### 🎯 Objectives
* Assess airline recovery from 2020 to 2025
* Compare recovery trends between Indian and Gulf airlines
* Analyze recovery across five key dimensions:
  1. Revenue & Financial Performance
  2. Passenger Traffic Recovery
  3. Capacity & Load Factor
  4. Fleet Size & Utilization
  5. Network & Route Expansion
* Create a composite Recovery Index benchmarked to 2019 = 100
